5. Press the Jailbreak button.
6. Be patient. (the more stuff you have on your device the longer it takes)
7. Be more patient.
8. After a device reboot Absinthe will still need some time to finish its work. Just wait until it says it's done.
9. There will be an Absinthe icon on your springboard, tap it to install cydia and finish the process.
10. Done, Enjoy!

NOTES: 

a) if during the process you get stuck on the "wait for absinthe to complete.." page you can take these steps:
	1. Tap Home,
	2. Goto Settings, General, Network, VPN
	3. Toggle the VPN to 'ON',
	4. Acknowledge the error and allow your device to reboot.

b) If your device is already jailbroken, there is no reason to re-apply the jailbreak if a newer version of Absinthe is released. For information on updates please refer to 'changelog.txt'.
